    <p>This collaborative project was conjured and presented by the California Summer Arts class of 2017 in Video Projection Mapping. We as a collective united of artists and creative minds alongside the coordinator of the class, G. Craig Hobbs, in conjunction with renowned guest artist, Yannick Jacquet, had two weeks to research, fabricate, creating visuals and presenting them via video mapping software to create an immersive visual marvel of imagination of the possible life that thrives on one of Jupiter's moons, Europa. We had access to Madmapper, several projectors, and one gymnasium hosted by Fresno State University.

    During the first week we, as a collective group, donned lab coats and went under the scope with bio-scientist,  Elizabeth Skovran from San Jose State University, to uncover the mysterious life of micro-organisms and bio-luminescence here on Earth. We then brainstormed possible strategies to execute for fabricating the structure which will be video projected on. Basing the structure on possible environment and ecosystems that could cover the landscape of the cold and icy moon. During the last week, we finalized the structure and began process creating 100% of the visual content ourselves using our own creative content of micro-organisms, and also remixing open source content.

    My role in this project was that of a leader, producer, and all around support source for all aspects of the project. Like the scope idea of digital media art itself, I used my various skill sets to help each team during the project. I was created particle systems and 3D visuals in Unity game engine, while also remixing footage of planets in space using Adobe Premiere and Aftereffects. During times off confusion, I would take it upon myself to formulate meetings, deadlines, and executive decisions which helped the completion of the project. My traditional skills were in use with some of the structure being lit by black-light to illuminate cave-like painting in that section. While lastly using my skills in fabrication to help strategize and set up the final look of the structure.
